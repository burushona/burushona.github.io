            This is a survey of the domain of morphological borrowing complemented with a case study of contact‐induced phenomena in the domain of verbal prefixes in Baltic, Slavic and neighbouring languages. Section 2 presents a concise overview of the main divisions and analytical problems of morphological borrowing, focusing on the distinction between matter borrowing and pattern borrowing, on the one hand, and on the borrowing of different types of morphology (e.g. derivation vs inflection, affixes vs processes, etc.). Section 3 further illustrates these issues on the basis of the data of the borrowing phenomena involving verbal prefixes in Baltic and Slavic, such as borrowing of individual prefixes from Slavic into Baltic dialects and of whole systems of prefixes from Slavic into Romani and Istro‐Romanian and from Baltic into Livonian, as well as cases of pattern replication involving verbal prefixes in Lithuanian, Yiddish and Romani. The borrowability of the Slavic and Baltic verbal aspect expressed by means of prefixation is also discussed, and it is shown that the aspectual values of borrowed prefixes are never exact copies of their counterparts in the source languages.},
