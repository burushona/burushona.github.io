            This is a survey of the domain of morphological borrowing complemented with a case study of contact‐induced phenomena in the domain of verbal prefixes in Baltic, Slavic and neighbouring languages. Section 2 presents a concise overview of the main divisions and analytical problems of morphological borrowing, focusing on the distinction between matter borrowing and pattern borrowing, on the one hand, and on the borrowing of different types of morphology (e.g. derivation vs inflection, affixes vs processes, etc.). Section 3 further illustrates these issues on the basis of the data of the borrowing phenomena involving verbal prefixes in Baltic and Slavic, such as borrowing of individual prefixes from Slavic into Baltic dialects and of whole systems of prefixes from Slavic into Romani and Istro‐Romanian and from Baltic into Livonian, as well as cases of pattern replication involving verbal prefixes in Lithuanian, Yiddish and Romani. The borrowability of the Slavic and Baltic verbal aspect expressed by means of prefixation is also discussed, and it is shown that the aspectual values of borrowed prefixes are never exact copies of their counterparts in the source languages.},

The results obtained for Baltic are compared with Slavic (Polish, Russian) and Finnic (Estonian, Finnish) data from comparable corpora. It is argued that out of all the languages under consideration, in Baltic the construction is the most frequent and the most fixed in its form, while at the same time being able to appear in various inflectional forms and in various functions. Other languages differ in how they deviate from the Baltic type. It is also shown that its semantics is largely context-dependent, being sensitive to the semantics of the inflectional form, subject and type of the lexical verb.},

Both suffixes express pluractionality, although of different types, and their distribution in Lithuanian dialects differs as well. Using corpus data, we find that in South Aukštaitian ‑dav‑ is rarer and -(d)inė‑ is more frequent than in East Aukštaitian; in Lithuanian dialects of Belarus -dav- is almost absent. We argue against the assumption that -(d)inėforms have extended into the domain of the past habitual at the expense of ‑dav‑ forms; a slightly higher token frequency of -(d)inė‑ in South Aukštaitian seems to apply irrespective of any particular tense. We also argue that only token-based analyses can substantiate claims concerning areal distribution of certain grammatical forms and constructions.},

	abstract = {The phenomenon of non-agreement of passive participles (mostly t-participles) is discussed on the basis of the TriMCo corpus of South-Eastern Lithuanian dialects. A quantitative analysis of the examples shows that non-agreeing t-participles appear significantly more often in East Aukštaitian than in South Aukštaitian. It is also shown that plural subjects and position of the participle before the subject increase the probability of the non-agreeing form. At the same time we show that (non-)agreement of passive constructions in South-Eastern Lithuanian dialects does not correlate with the semantic type of passive. We also argue that the Lithuanian dialectal constructions with non-agreeing passive participles are most probably not related to the similar constructions in East Slavic (either areally, or diachronically). The non-agreeing passive constructions are also not areally related to non-agreeing active participle constructions, but probably illustrate the same tendency for the lack of agreement with plural subjects.},

The data show that, when the two suffixes are combined within the same verb form, -dav- always scopes over -inė-, thus, the combination of the two suffixes usually describes the repetition of different situations such as processes, progressive situations, punctual events, delimited processes etc. Most of the data used in the article come from the Web corpus of Lithuanian.},

            The article discusses dialectal and folkloristic features of an oral narrative in a North-Eastern Neo-Aramaic (NENA) variety recently recorded in the Southern Russian village of Urmiya. The dialect of the tale belongs to the NENA varieties originating in the easternmost regions of Turkey, which is corroborated by the tale’s speaker, who named its places of origin as Lewən, Albaq, and Gawar. These dialects remain largely undescribed and are highly endangered. The plot of the story is not known from hitherto published Neo-Aramaic field texts. Even though it resembles some of the folktales recorded in Iran and India, the story contains a unique combination of narrative motifs.},
